## Chart.js
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

**Drawing a bar chart**
```
<canvas id="income" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
var income = document.getElementById("income").getContext("2d");
new Chart(income).Bar(barData);
var barData = {
	labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
	datasets : [
		{
			fillColor : "#48A497",
			strokeColor : "#48A4D1",
			data : [456,479,324,569,702,600]
		},
		{
			fillColor : "rgba(73,188,170,0.4)",
			strokeColor : "rgba(72,174,209,0.4)",
			data : [364,504,605,400,345,320]
		}

	]
}
```
## The canvas element
```
<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
```
At first sight a canvas looks like the img element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the canvas element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

## Fallback content
The canvas element differs from an img tag in that, like for video, audio, or picture elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.

Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the canvas element. Browsers that don't support canvas will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support canvas will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.

For example, we could provide a text description of the canvas content or provide a static image of the dynamically rendered content. This can look something like this:

```
<canvas id="stockGraph" width="150" height="150">
  current stock price: $3.15 + 0.15
</canvas>

<canvas id="clock" width="150" height="150">
  <img src="images/clock.png" width="150" height="150" alt=""/>
</canvas>
```
Telling the user to use a different browser that supports canvas does not help users who can't read the canvas at all, for example. Providing a useful fallback text or sub DOM helps to make the canvas more accessible.

Required canvas tag
As a consequence of the way fallback is provided, unlike the img element, the canvas element requires the closing tag (canvas). If this tag is not present, the rest of the document would be considered the fallback content and wouldn't be displayed.

If fallback content is not needed, a simple ``` <canvas id="foo" ...></canvas> ``` is fully compatible with all browsers that support canvas at all.

**The grid**
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.

**Drawing rectangles**
Unlike SVG, canvas only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.

First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a filled rectangle.
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectangular outline.
clearRect(x, y, width, height)
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size.
