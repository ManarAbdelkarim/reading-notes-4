## HTML Structure  
any html page should consist of: 
1. head: This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page).
1. body: Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
1. title: The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).  
  

### Quick Summary

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the   X <!-- and --> markers. * The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The  <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
<iframes> X cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

* The  <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special  X characters in your pages such as <, >, and @  
  
 ## The different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminolog (Links to an external site.)
* People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

* Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them 3-Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.

* People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.  
  
  ## Process & Design
You should start by knowing who’s your audience, why they use your site, and what information they look to find. Don’t forget to start after that with a site maps to allow you to plan the structure of a site. You also need to use wireframes to organize the information that will need to go on each page. Design is a way of communication with your audience. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. Finally, by using size, color, and style you make the differentiation between pieces of information easier.  
  
  ## Java Script
### What is Java script?
Java Script is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.).
