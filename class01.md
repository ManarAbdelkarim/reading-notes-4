# Read01: Introductory HTML and JavaScript  

## HTML Structure  
any html page should consist of: 
1. head: This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page).
1. body: Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
1. title: The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
