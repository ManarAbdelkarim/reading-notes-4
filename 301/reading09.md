## Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming style of building the structure and elements of programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## Pure Functions

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects.

## Referential transparency
if a function consistently gives the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent. pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

functions are also treated as values and used as data.
