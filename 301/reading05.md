## Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

Heroku and data
Heroku is a platform for data as well as apps - providing a secure, scalable database-as-a-service with tons of developers tools like database followers, forking, dataclips and automated health checks.

Data lies at the heart of any significant app — whether it's customer data or data about the service it provides — an app and its data go hand in hand. Heroku's rich ecosystem of managed data services includes Heroku Postgres, Heroku Redis and Apache Kafka on Heroku.

Developers shouldn't need to discover how to optimally provision a database through trial and error - but instead have immediate access to a scalable, highly available database with rollback - one that supports their apps and development style.

An ecosystem of services
Heroku is an ecosystem of cloud services, which can be used to instantly extend applications with fully-managed services.

Using an existing, high-quality service is something that empowers developers - they can build more, faster, by using trusted services that provide the functionality that they require.

Heroku Add-ons are fully-managed services, integrated for use with Heroku. They can be provisioned and scaled in one command, and let developers extend the capabilities of an application.

Over 175 Add-ons are available, providing services ranging from databases to uptime alerts, messaging services or automatic backups to search, metrics or mail delivery.
