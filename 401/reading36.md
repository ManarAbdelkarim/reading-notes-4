# Reading36: Application State with Redux

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- **What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”**  
  The server can access it, and it has larger size than local storage
- **Explain 3rd party cookies.**  
  cookies that created by domains not by client itself, ued for ads serving
- **How do pixel tags work?**  
  (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage that allow websites to do things like read and place cookies. The resulting connection can include information such as the person’s IP address, the time the person viewed the pixel and the type of browser being used.

## Terms

- **cookies**: small amount of data that is stored in the user’s computer by the web browser while browsing a website.
- **authorization**: security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features.
- **access control**: To restrict system access to authorized users only.
- **conditional rendering**: ability to render different UI markup based on certain conditions.

## Preview

#### Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

The first principle of Redux is that everything that changes in your application, including the data and the UI state, is contained in a single object, we call the state or the state tree.
