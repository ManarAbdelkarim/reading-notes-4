### Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?

Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node.js technology to execute your JavaScript code. This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

### What is the difference between a module and a package?

Modules are libraries for Node.js, Node.js has a simple module loading system. In Node.js, files and modules are in one-to-one correspondence.

A package is one or more modules (libraries) grouped (or packaged) together. These are commonly used by other packages or a project of your own. Node.js uses a package manager, where you can find and install thousands of packages.

A module is a single JavaScript file that has some reasonable functionality.

A package is a directory with one or more modules inside of it and a package.json file which has metadata about the package.

### What does the node package manager do?

npm, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.
